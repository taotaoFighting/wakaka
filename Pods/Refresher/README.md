Refresher is pull to refresh library written in Swift. It provides easy to use UIScrollView methods to add pull to refresh to your view. 
Refresher also supports custom animations.

##Usage

###Basic usage

```swift
tableView.addPullToRefreshWithAction {
	NSOperationQueue().addOperationWithBlock {
    	sleep(2)
        NSOperationQueue.mainQueue().addOperationWithBlock {
        	self.tableView.stopPullToRefresh()
        }
    }
}
```

###Custom animations

Refresher supports custom animations on `PullToRefreshView`. You need to create object that conforms to `PullToRefreshViewAnimator` protocol.
Then, just pass your custom animator in `addPullToRefrshWithAction`:

```swift
tableView.addPullToRefreshWithAction({           
  	NSOperationQueue().addOperationWithBlock {
   		sleep(2)
        NSOperationQueue.mainQueue().addOperationWithBlock {
        	self.tableView.stopPullToRefresh()
        }
    }
}, withAnimator: CustomAnimator())
```

Required methods that your custom object need to implement are:

*   `func pullToRefreshAnimationDidStart(view: PullToRefreshView)`- Called when user releases finger and when loading actually starts. Start your animations here.
*   `func pullToRefreshAnimationDidEnd(view: PullToRefreshView)` - Called when animation is over. Perform any necessary after animation cleanup here.
*   `func pullToRefresh(view: PullToRefreshView, progressDidChange progress: CGFloat)` - Called while user is pulling scroll view. Useful if you want to implement some kind of progress like behaviour.
*   `func pullToRefresh(view: PullToRefreshView, stateDidChange state: PullToRefreshViewState)` - Called when `PullToRefreshView` changes its state  


###Custom views

You can use your own custom `UIView` subclass as pull to refresh view.

```swift

if let customSubview = NSBundle.mainBundle().loadNibNamed("CustomSubview", owner: self, options: nil).first as? CustomSubview {
	tableView.addPullToRefreshWithAction({
		NSOperationQueue().addOperationWithBlock {
			sleep(2)
			NSOperationQueue.mainQueue().addOperationWithBlock {
				self.tableView.stopPullToRefresh()
			}
		}
	}, withAnimator: customSubview)
}
```

Your custom subclass has to conform to `PullToRefreshViewDelegate`.

##Requirements

*	Xcode 6
*	iOS 8.0
